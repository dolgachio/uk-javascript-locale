  <p>The Modern JavaScript Tutorial was created in 2007 by Ilya Kantor, and regularly updated since then. New chapters were added, outdated ones - removed, to stay fresh. The PDF version is about 1300 pages, starting from the beginning, and then to advanced topics.</p>
  <p>It's a book, not a video, as for many people reading is faster. Also, books are easier to update, keep modern :).</p>
  <p>The content of this tutorial is <a href="https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info">open source</a> and everyone is welcome to contribute.</p>
